Notes from The Vearidons:

None of these conversions would have happened without the technical aid of GeneralBlackDragon, who walked me through the new things involving maps and mods and answered all of my questions as I asked them.

So credits go to him so I did not need to invest more than a few hours of time.

The map descriptions/names are usually derived from 1.3 era BZ2 inside jokes or just random youtube comments I found amusing.
