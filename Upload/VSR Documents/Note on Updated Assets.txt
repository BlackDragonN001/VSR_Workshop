The assets in this mod were created by BZ2 community members over the years. Because these assets were used in ZST and
I am converting the maps to BZCC, I am updating the "looks" of these assets to fit the improved graphics. If you find
one of your assets in here and don't like how it has been updated or improved, please send me a message on Steam and I
can remove it/replace it (with the hope that YOU will be updating it on your own so that people can still benefit from
it).
