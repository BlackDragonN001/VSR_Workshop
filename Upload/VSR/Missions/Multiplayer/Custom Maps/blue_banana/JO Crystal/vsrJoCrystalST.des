JO CRYSTAL
Pools: 7
Loose: 250
A healing crystal awaits being pushed out of the northern route. Destroying it unleashes its energy and takes another minute to regenerate.

The crystal I wear around my neck contains an essence that gets recharged when I jack it with a thug who also has a crystal. It gives me confidence at mid, home, social situations, etc. Nobody knows it's a JO crystal but me and my thugs. I have seen it glow white while jerking it with a thug thats how I know this is real. You can come over for as long as you want but I need a picture of you preferably wearing a crystal before I waste my time.
