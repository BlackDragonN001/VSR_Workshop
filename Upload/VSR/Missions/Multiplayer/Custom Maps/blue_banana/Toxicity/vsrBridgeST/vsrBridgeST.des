TOXICITY
Pools: 7
Loose: 250

You thought CS:GO had a toxic community? Try VSR Strats. It's horrible. A toxic wasteland with not a kind soul in sight. There always needs to be someone to pick on and if you join their game it might be you. Please heed my warning. I can't stress this enough and I could write 30 pages about this if I keep going.
