Man, we just wanted some food after getting smashed at the bars. We stopped at Taco Bell and I ordered a chalupa. My friend could not keep his shirt on. Guess he is one of those drunks. Meanwhile, some drunk high school kids came in after us. This lanky kid comes up right after I unwrap my chalupa, takes it off my tray, and starts eating it. About halfway through, he sets it down and starts trying to have a conversation. That is when he looked at me, in his drunken stupor, and asked, "are you going to finish that?" while pointing at my chalupa he just ate. I looked him dead in the eyes and said, "Yes."
