Why don't we have a choice as to wether or not to exist in this broken world? Why do we even exist in the first place? What's the meaning of life? Does God exist? What/Who is God anyways? Were we created? Why is there so much nonsensical war in the world? Why is society so cruel and unfair? Wht happens after we die? Is the universe infinitely big? Do sentient, alien life forms exist out there?
