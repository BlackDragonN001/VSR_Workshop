You got away with disrespecting me last time, don't think you will be so lucky this time though I do belive in second chances, but let me ask you this, do you have a problem with me? I never did anything disrespectfull to you, infact I leave you alone, maybe you are just trying to show off. What ever the reason is stay the fuck out my way untill you do have a reason.
