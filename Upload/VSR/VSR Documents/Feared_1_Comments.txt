As of Release 1...
I have converted VSR to Battlezone: Combat Commander ONLY to the most superficial level possible. The
reason for this is because I wanted to make sure that the "1.2-style" physics were integrated into the
game EARLY to appeal to returning players.

It should be noted that I am by no means an expert at any of this stuff, and I only did as much as I
was capable of doing with help from outside people (who, at the time of this conversion, are
extremely busy with other BZCC stuff).

As of 1st release, this mod does not include Hadeans, Daedlians, "Plus" or "Experimental" options,
maps, shell options, FFA, MPI, or anything involving stuff that I don't know how to do. These
components WILL be integrated into VSR slowly as more people work on it. Here is what Release 1 DOES
include:

1. VSR Variants of ISDF and Scion races (including 1.2-style physics and weapon balance)
2. Stock maps set up with appropriate pre-game options (ie. player limit 10 and VSR starting units)
3. Stock maps set up to spawn a VSR Recycler for a basic ISDF and Scion VSR experience
4. VSR added to Steam workshop for easy access and download

Below is a list of SPECIFIC things that have been done so someone can go back and revert them to
what they were before when the mod becomes more complete in BZCC.

A special thanks to General BlackDragon for helping me get all of the stuff working right in game!
A special thanks to Nielk1 for helping me get VSR into the correct format for workshop integration!

This would not have been possible without them (and they probably would have done it themselves
eventually if I hadn't done it....... but oh well).

Enjoy!!

UPDATE: This log is now obsolete, as the rest of VSR has been ported over to BZCC! I will keep this file as a changelog.
	VSR is completely converted as of Release 53, thanks to General BlackDragon.

Changes made to VSR leading up to full conversion:



==Release 1==
March 9th, 2018

A few modifications have been made by me to get rid of error messages or other incompatibilities
from 1.3 -> BZCC. This is a list of things I have done to get VSR into BZCC (all can be reverted
later):

1. VSR STANDARD variant ISDF & Scion races copied over.
	a. apserv_vsr.odf was also copied over.
	b. A few changes had to be made in the conversion to prevent errors; these can be reverted later:
		i. VSR Mortar bike was given the STOCK BZCC model rather than the larger(?) one.
		ii. Scion Seeker mine was given the STOCK BZCC model rather than the smaller(?) one.
		iii. ISDF & Scion Jetpacks were given the STOCK BZCC models. (changed in Release 13, see comments)
		iv. Scion Scout skin had to be changed to STOCK BZCC skin (really doesn't matter).

2. Two vehicle lists were copied over:
	a. mpvehiclesvsr.odf (for selecting VSR units upon the start of the game) (Modified in Release 31 for Hadean integration)
		i. VSR variants of units that are normally included in a stock map were included on this list. (so it could be applied to DM as well)
		ii. Unit names were modified to match the stock BZCC unit names. (example: Sabre -> Tank)
	b. stratstartingvsr.odf (for starting strats with some forces at the start of the game)
		i. The only change made here was that the starting units were modified to be VSR variants. (should have have already happened?)

3. BZCC stock map .inf and .bzn files were copied to VSR\Missions\Multiplayer\Stock Maps\
	a. VSR's .inf file contents were copied from 1.3 to the .inf's in the above folder.
	b. "Non-stock" or unused ivars/svars were commented out for the time being.
	c. New VSR vehicle lists were applied to these maps.
	d. See .inf files for any other changes that have been made (I noted them where applicable).
	e. Added svar8 = "STCheck.odf" to strat .inf files to avoid error messages. (changed in Release 3, see comments)

4. ivrecy_vsr.autoreg copied to VSR\Autoreg and modified description to say "VSR BZCC" instead of "VSR 6.0" for BZCC integration.

5. All files thrown into a workshop-compatible format.



==Release 2==
March 12th, 2018

-Converted 11 maps from 1.3 to BZCC.
	Adjusted sky, terrain color, and terrain textures (if there was a problem) in order to look good in the new game; BZCC's terrain colors mainly come from the texture set, so generally colors had to be completely removed from maps

-Converted 5 more maps to BZCC from 1.3 (Bladicus)

-Included 3 maps from Aegeis who updated his own maps from 1.3 to BZCC
	(this is testing VSR's ability to call on and use other map packs not included with VSR)

-2 NEW maps added (Two Hills and ScionCentral) created by ExE (Changed in release 10, see notes)

==Release 11==
July 6th, 2018

-Magma's "vanishing pool" no longer vanishes
-Converted 2 more strat maps from 1.3 to BZCC (Mojave and Sahara)

-Relay Bunker, Antenna Mound, & Overseer Array zoom no longer "pulsates" in and out in multiplayer

	2. SITE camera removed - it was never used & the hardpoint wasn't added to the model (can be added later if requested)
