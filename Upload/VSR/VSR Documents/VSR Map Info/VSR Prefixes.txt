Use the following prefixes to classify what your map can do:

ST: (Svar7 = VSRst) Stock map, but has the same capabilities as "VSR:"
VSR: (Svar7 = VSRst) Team Strat AND MPI-capable AND ST Capture-capable
VSR FFA: (Svar7 = VSRffa) FFA strat and FFA MPI (with teams enabled)
VSR ST: (Svar7 = st) Team strat only (with default strat settings) <- use this if you don't have path points on your map to spawn AI enemies for MPI (see Game Mode Map Paths.txt)
VSR DM: (Svar7 = dm) Deathmatch that allows for VSR bots and VSR vehicle selection
