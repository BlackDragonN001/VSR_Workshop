Enables MPI on strat maps in VSR (really only the first two are REQUIRED, but the others make it more robust)

==================================
New game mode (ST Capture); *put the LAST points in the base areas*:

capturegoal1
capturegoal2
capturegoal3
capturegoal4
capturegoal5
capturegoal6  <-- most maps stop here
.
.
.
capturegoal16

And then in the .TRN file:

[DLL]
CaptureTarget1 = ""
CaptureTarget2 = ""
.
.
.
CaptureTarget16 = ""
