See example at bottom if this is confusing, but this is how you set up FFA MPI path points...

Place the player path points in some kind of order going around each base area - 15 players maximum (one per base area)

Player_1
Player_2
Player_3
.
.
.
Player_15


THEN, place AI enemy path points in the same base areas going in REVERSE ORDER of the player path points, but DO NOT put an enemy path point in Player_1's base.
Enemy path points should go in decreasing order ENDING with Enemy_6, STARTING with whatever Enemy_# would result in ENDING with Enemy_6

Enemy_15
Enemy_14
Enemy_13
.
.
.
Enemy_6


FOR EXAMPLE:
On a map, LEFT to RIGHT would be placed the players, RIGHT to LEFT would be placed the enemies such that you END with Enemy_6 in the base area RIGHT of Player_1:

Player_1 | Player_2 | Player_3 | Player_4 | Player_5 |
(NoEnemy)|  Enemy_6 |  Enemy_7 |  Enemy_8 |  Enemy_9 |

This will ensure that the enemies will start the farthest away from the humans and fill up in their direction, and vise-versa with the humans filling toward the enemies.
