NOTE: This file has not been modified since 1.3. These changes document changes to VSR up until VSR 6.0 (in version 1.3 of Battlezone II). To see a list of changes that have been made AFTER this document, see "Feared_1 Comments.txt" and "VSR changes since BZCC.txt."


* Global Changes:
  Greater air control of hover craft and 1.2 feel added. This is the primary feature of VSR.
  Turrets turn much faster and aim better, like in 1.2.
  Turrets take 1/3 the time to undeploy.
  Turret resale value increased from 10 to 15.
  Pilotable combat units, pilots and service trucks are now immune to 1.3 buildzone push. http://bz2maps.us/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=4863
  Service pods now build 43% faster.
  Empty scouts now build in 10 seconds instead of 15, unless upgraded.
  Scion units will no longer try to morph to attack mines.
  Units have equivalent mass to their racial counterparts. This involves the pushability of cons, scavs, etc...
  * Pilots:
    Sniper range reduced from 300 meters to 200 meters.
    Pilot jetpacks activate instantly when usable, like in 1.2.
    Jetpacks not usable for 1.5 seconds after hopping out of ship. (Reduces "special key" misfires in laggy games)
  * Utility Vehicles:
    Scavengers have a larger collision radius so groups of them will spread out more. (Reduces chance of merging)
    Scavengers respond 300% sharper to turning.
    Service trucks automatic healing range increased from 30 to 40 meters.
    Service trucks now automatically heal nearby buildings in addition to vehicles.
  * Extractors:
    Upgraded extractors have "+" appended to name.
    Upgraded extractor scrap value is now 20. Stock scrap value is 2 (isdf) and 40 (scion). Unupgraded extractors are 20.
    Initial scrap waiting period of 12 seconds for both extractors and upgrades removed. http://bz2maps.us/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=5061
  * Buildings:
    Default drop off points now closer to armories, this fixes the common issue of accidentally dropping crates into adjacent buildings.
    Added ability to zoom in/out an extra 100 meters while in comm bunker view.

* ISDF:
  * Pilots:
    Respawning ISDF pilots now spawn with the same amount of health as Scion. (100 instead of stock 250)
