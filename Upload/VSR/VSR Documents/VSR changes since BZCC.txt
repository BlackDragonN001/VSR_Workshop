This document is a list of gameplay items that have been changed since converting VSR to BZCC (not including 1.3 changes).

Release 1: VSR Mortar Bike given stock BZCC model: For compatabiliy
Release 1: Seeker Mine given stock BZCC model: For compatibility
Release 1: Units renamed to match stock BZCC names: To be consistent with BZCC
Release 13: Removed omegaKick from Chain Gun and Pummel: To improve multiplayer gameplay performance (omegaKick on these weapons is STOCK in BZCC, now)
Release 13: Min/Max zoom distance removed on satellite buildings: This caused a "pulsating" problem in BZCC
Release 40: MAG drop cost reduced to 20 scrap from 30 scrap (33% decrease): minor change to hopefully allow more usage in games (requested by community)
Release 41: JabbaPop's JChat keys added for quick chatting, chat setting changes, and other things that can be done with a single button press (can be overridden by putting a copy of bzgame_keys.cfg in your My Documents addon folder)
Release 53: Kiln is no longer a requirement for a Healer: To be consistent with other races only requiring the service bay building
Release 55: New game mode ST: Capture allows you to capture points around the map for perks... the team that captures all of the points wins
Release 55: "Respawn with Sniper" shell option is now "Sniper:" and can be set to ON (for starting sniper), OFF (for no sniper), or RESPAWN (for respawn w/ sniper)
Release 56: "Sniper:" option now defaults to OFF (no sniper at all at the start of the game), but this can be changed after map has been selected
Release 64: ISDF Sniper Rifle now requires a Relay Bunker to build from Armory (community poll), Scion requires Antenna Mound, Hadean requires Eyes of Xyr
Release 68: Hornet Rocket, Shadower Missile, and Photon Torpedo can no longer lock onto friendly targets at all, preventing AI from accidentally locking onto friendly things
Release 68: Delay on firing Sniper Rifle upon hopping out of ship removed per community poll
Release 69: Xares FS and Xares SGS now have 300 meter radar range, the stock one still has 325 to compensate for slower speed
Release 69: Xypos SX given the same HP boost as the Xypos full scout (2200 instead of 1800)
Release 69: Hadean ship names with weapon codes now have the weapon codes capitalized to look better
Release 70: Scion Popper shotspeed has been doubled so the shots can't be outrun by Bombers or other relatively slow units
Release 72: Xerrakis Explode mine will spawn at ship height rather than on the ground - this allows the Xerrakis to blow up in mid-air using the mine
Release 76: Bomber's bomb drops at 3x the stock max speed and has 2x more armor to make the Bomber more practical
Release 81: Turrets can no longer shoot straight down at mines placed underneath them, flaring turrets is still a viable tactic
Release 83: Camera Pods' now have perfect radar (range is 500 meters for some reason)
