Do not modify, add, or remove anything in this folder.
If you want to change something (custom keys, custom shell settings, etc.), you need to do it at the following location:

...My Documents\My Games\Battlezone Combat Commander\addon

Note that the addon folder does not exist by default:
Create a NEW folder in the "Battlezone Combat Commander" folder called "addon" (no quotes).

Anything that you wish to modify or add to VSR or BZCC in general needs to be done in that addon folder.

For specific modification settings for content included with VSR, read the individual instruction files in each folder.


WARNING: Not everything in the new addon folder can be added or modified without causing "bad assets" kicks from games.
		If you add something to addon that causes bad assets, simply remove it (or fix it).
