By default, numpad enter invokes the jChat menu. The numpad number keys navigate the lists; when outside of lists, numpad number keys also send the associated chat message from the most previously closed list. Entering and exiting the jChat main menu without selecting a list reverts quickchat keys to the first list.

jChat mod is highly customizable on the user end, enabling relatively easy modification of both the bindings for keys and the messages sent. Unlike previous keybind mods, these settings are stored in BZGAME_JCHAT_LISTS.CFG. If you are trying to modify BZGAME_JCHAT_LISTS.CFG (to change your Newkeys), you need to follow these instructions:

1. COPY BZGAME_JCHAT_LISTS.CFG from this folder (right click, select COPY)
2. NAVIGATE to the following directory in your computer:
	\My Documents\My Games\Battlezone Combat Commander\
If there is not already an "addon" folder in this directory you will need to make your own - just right click and choose "New Folder" - name it "addon" (no quotes)
3. PASTE BZGAME_JCHAT_LISTS.CFG into the addon folder.
4. OPEN Notepad or other text editing software and OPEN the newly-copied file you just placed in addon.
5. MODIFY the COPIED BZGAME_JCHAT_LISTS.CFG file (in the addon folder) as desired (see instructions below)

This will prevent your keys from being overridden when mod updates. The BZGAME_JCHAT_LISTS.CFG file in addon will
ALWAYS override the one in the workshop folder. If you screw something up, DELETE the BZGAME_JCHAT_LISTS.CFG file in
ADDON and restart from step 1.


===MODIFYING MESSAGES===

The rules of modifying the messages are simple.
Each list of messages is housed in a control "JChatListX," where X is a number from 1-10; with the exception of JChatList1, which houses is messages in the control above (for efficiency purposes in setting default bindings.)
The text you will be modfying for any lists are:

		Cmd("jchat.title 'List Title'"); and Cmd("jchat.msgX 'Message'");

These correspond to the title of the list in the ui, and the actual chatline, respectively. When editing, only modify WITHIN the single apostrophes ('List Title' and 'Message').
Do not include punctuation beyond periods (.), exclamation (!) , and question mark (?) --- anything else runs the risk of breaking the code.


===MODIFYING KEYBINDS===

Keybinds for quickkeys, as well as the interface for jChat menus, can be modified in BZGAME_JCHAT_LISTS.CFG (YOU WILL NEED TO COPY THIS FILE TO ADDON AS WELL TO MODIFY). The values are located at the top of the file, under ConfigureVarSys(). You are able to modify the keys used in the list interface and the quickchat keys seperately. There are comments denoted by // marks explaining how to edit.

If you would like to add any further keybinds, outside of the jChat menu binds and quickkey binds, you can add them at the end of the BZGAME_JCHAT_LISTS.CFG file.
