A very large bounty on your head for that!
Access Violation! Access Violation!  What the heck! That always worked before the 1.21 patch... Crap!
All the more sweeter our revenge will be.
Are you people familiar with the word "defense"?
Cheating Hacker!!!
Come back here, I'm not finished with you! I'll gnaw your bloody legs off!
DOH! DOH! DOH!
Deep Blue I've failed you!
Good game. Rematch?
Hah! ...took you long enough.
Hah, there's alot more where that came from.
Hey maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got our ASSES kicked pal!
I LET you win, so you wouldn't feel bad.
I don't mean to distract you, but when was the last time you backed up your hard drive?
I guess even losers like you get lucky sometimes.
I knew I shoulda had a healer on that.
I knew I shouldn't have relied on treaded vehicles.
I suppose you think that was funny.
I was under the impression our gun towers were working... did I miss something?
I'd have won if it weren't for you darn kids!
I'll be back...
I'll send my delegation right over to negotiate the cease-fire.
I'm gonna lag out every other game you have tonight.
I'm just luring you into a false sense of security.
If I didn't let you win once in a while you'd stop playing.
If it weren't for you meddling kids!
Its time for another balance discussion.
Lucky shot...
CHEATER!!!
Medic!
Next stop, Cybertron!
No fair! My scavengers got stuck in my buildings.
Nooooooooooooooo!
Now that was lame.
Oh the shame of it , how will I ever live this down.
Oh yeah? I got more where that came from!!
Ok, this wasn't in the script.
Oops! I had my AI level set on 1!
Seen the matrix? Our day will come...
Somebody scrape this guy off.
Terminator, now there's a movie. I hate to see the good guy get dismantled like that, but it worked for me on a binary level.
He's shooting at me!
That tickles. Wait! no it doesn't.
That's it man, game over man, game over! What are we gonna do now? What are we gonna do?
There's no need to get so excited, have you taken your medication today?
Through great suffering, comes great wisdom.
Try that again and you'll be sorry.
Um...I wasn't paying attention. I was talkin to Ms. Cleo on the phone...
What do you mean "they cut the power"?  How could they cut the power, man? They're animals!
What?  That was just a scratch.  Come back and I'll fight you some more.
YOU CHEATED!!!
Yeah, well, Big Blue is a good friend of mine and he's going to come over and kick your butt for that.
You cannot embrace victory without accepting defeat.
You got lucky, punk.
You guys were lagging and warping so bad, no wonder you won.  Why don't you try a real PC and a real connection next time?
You rushed me.
You should see what we're doing to YOUR recy!
why to loose when he can use lag button and he can win?
