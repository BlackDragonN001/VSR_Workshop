Ahhh, did yo litt'l Recycler go boom?
Attack successful.
Better luck next time, NOT!
Didn't need to AV you; you lost anyways.
Don't feel bad, you did the best you could.
Don't go away angry, just go away!
Don't say I never told you so.
Don't worry, I'll finish your factory in, oooo, say an hour, and BTW no quitting!!
Don't you just hate it when that happens?
Enjoy the Stone Age! Muhahaha.
Gosh, you really suck dont you?  I'll go easier next time.
Hey stop crying, it's only a game.
Humiliations galore!
I am a machine, I feel no emotion, I will not laugh at you're misfortune, hahahaha who the hell am I kidding!
I am sooo overclocked...
I guess this is goodbye, for now.
I haven't even brought out the lvl 3 AI yet.
I hope you guys are good at throwing rocks, LOL.
I'm a baaadddd boy; I bwoke dat widdle weccy!
Is that all you got!?
It's evolution baby.
Let me put it this way. Have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates? Morons.
Lets see you get anywhere now!
Looooooser!
Never pit mushy, wet carbon against lightning-fast silicon!
Now I don't think you really wanted to lose that.
Now that wasn't very clever was it?
Now what are you gonna do, huh?
Oh am I winning? Sorry, I wan't paying attention there.
Oh look, their Reccy was full of Barbie Dolls!
Oh, were you still using that?? Sorry...
Pathetic, maybe you should take up knitting, it's safer.
Play the dirge!
That was easy.
That's IT?  You couldnt whoop a TRS-80!
This is too easy, just like taking candy from a baby.
To lose a tank is unfortunate, to lose a whole Recycler is just plain careless.
We're everywhere, we're everywhere!
What ya gonna do when they come for you?
Who's your daddy? Who's you daddy eh eh? :D
You call that putting up a fight?
You could at least try and put up a fight.
You could have destroyed that yourselves, it would have saved me the effort.
You didn't wanna do it like that!
You have proven unworthy.
You lose...
You should have given yourself more starting units.
You should have invested more in skill than towers.
You're regretting your last PC upgrade now arent ya?
Your momma's gonna feel that!
Your resistance is flawed.
im one of the only ppl i know that arent shit talkers, i just dont talk shit.

I havent seen someone fail that hard in a long time

You really, REALLY suck.
