VSR EXPRESSWAY TUNNELS

Can be used to provide quick transport through underground tunnel networks by 
rapidly flinging a craft through it.


USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

1) Place small underground tunnel entrance (pbatun03)

2) Eyedrop the small underground entrance you just placed (to get its height value)

3) Uncheck 'ground' and check 'align' to place an aligned pushtun01vsr

4) Then place several normal tunnel segments (pbatun05)

5) Place 2 braking tunnels (the second one is important to act as a back up in case the
   first braking segment fails to work)

6) Now align the expressway and braking tunnel segments by selecting the 'move' tool, 
   holding right-click, and dragging your mouse to the direction you want the tunnel
   segments to face (which is in the direction you desire the user to go).

6) Now you can place a corner (and then new expressway/exit tunnels) or just place
   another tunnel entrance at the other end to serve as the exit to the tunnel network.


REFERENCE:

pushtun01vsr

Expressway Tunnel segment, rapidly fires a unit down a tunnel corridor

pushtun02vsr

Braking Tunnel segment, used to slow units down to normal speed.
