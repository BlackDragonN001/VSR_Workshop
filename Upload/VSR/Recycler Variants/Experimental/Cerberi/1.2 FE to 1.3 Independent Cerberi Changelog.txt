This is a simple independent 1.2 conversion of Cerberi to 1.3 from FE mod.
The council of matesmonkeys have *officially* classified these assets in the public domain.

Very little has been changed that wasn't absolutely necessary, you will find this very near identical to 1.2.

Testing:
- Tested log files for any errors derivable from unit assets being loaded.
- Tested treaded unit AI behaviour on complicated maps.
- Tested and fixed AI aiming that may have been affected by 1.3 turret behaviour changes.
- Did general full base build test.

Global changes:
- Added INF files where missing.
- Assets that are to be copied from Hadean for Cerberi asset independence, or names with high probability of conflict, have had CERB added to the name.
- Reorganized and renamed asset hierarchy into a consistent format instead of being a mess.
- Various name fixes, e.g. some build requirement texts had ISDF building names.

Unit changes:
- Default pilot is now Scion, as error.odf is no longer going to default to the Hadean pilot.
- Disabled unit voiceovers; no need to copy Hadean voice files for a race intended for NPC use.
- Scaled scavenger up to the standard 1.3 scavenger size. This was a change made in 1.3 to match scavengers up to their deployed extractor scale.
- Gave Harpie minelayer class, though it still doesn't seem to lay mines on command.
- Gave Harpie a working unit icon.
- Added wireframes for Triton, Krul, and Siren to suppress errors in log files.

Building changes:
- Research Node: Only one allowed.
- Dispenser Node: Removed empty "Specials" and "Pilot" weapon groups.
- Excluder: Like the Jammer, now owns terrain so you cannot construct other buildings ontop of it.

Weapon changes:
- XX-120 (Cerberi FAF): Assault alt name now points back to its own combat version, instead of ISDF FAF. (Morphing twice resulted in a third weapon)
- Ceberi Laser: Enabled morphing weapon into the to already existing assault version.
- Ceberi Laser: Now uses gun weapon crate instead of cannon crate.
- CVX-300 TAIL/NEO (Cerberi Comet): Players can only lock on from the same range as AI now, not 500 meters.
