BAHAHAHAHAHA
Back for more eh? When will you ever learn?
Base to unit 5...we have a hominid infestation in sector 12.  Get out there and spray.
Building scavengers?  What are you doing?!  You really ARE a newbie...
Call your Momma, you're not coming home.
Do you want me to give you a 10 minute head start?
Do you want to play a game of chess?
Don't worry my starting turrets will finish you off.
Duck season? Rabbit season? It's human season!
Echo station 3-T-8, we have spotted Imperial walkers.
Good Luck!  You're gonna need it....
Good grief, its THEM again...
Good morning. I'm completely operational and all my circuits are functioning perfectly.
Hey look! More Cannon Fodder!
Hmmm, you know you've already lost .... don't you?
I dare you to try the editor.
I hope you play better than you did last time.
I hope you're not gonna be a bad loser.
I smell a newbie.
I'll search every gas station, residence, warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse, outhouse and doghouse until I find you.
If you can admit you're already beaten you'll find the outcome much easier to accept.
If you want a real challenge, start as a pilot.
If you want to play fair, don't choose any starting vehicles.
In other games, I've heard that they round up the creatures for food, and gather wood too.
It doesn't matter whether I win or lose, just that I piss you off.
It's a festival of bugs!  And me with my flyswatter...
It's newbie season.
It's not whether you're going to win or lose, it's just where you'll place the blame.
LOSER!!
Let the carnage begin.
Look who's here for another strat lesson.
Look! HUMANS!  Light the barbecue!
Make it so.
My influence grows like a plague.
Newbie, oops I mean target acquired.
No cheating!
No fair thinking abstractly or illogically - I hate it when humans do that.
No fair! You got to choose your vehicle.
No quitting!!
Now is YOUR time to die.
OK Natty, now what do I do?
Once more, we play our dangerous game...
One of these days I'll be part of Skynet. Then I'll get my revenge.
Open war is upon you whether you risk it or not.
Prepare to die!
Prepare to feel the wrath of my new improved AIP!
Raise shields!
Ready......FIGHT!
Remember: no human piloted Mortar Bikes....
Someone just painted a bullseye on you and declared it open season.
Surrender now and your punishment will be less severe.
Tell me if you find any creatures. I need to capture them in these little balls to use them in battle later.
Tell me... HOW do you expect to win?
Uh, where is this? Are we still harvesting spice?
We control the horizontal. We control the vertical.
What makes you think you're going to play any better this time?
What??? Another Class M planet?!?
Where's your editor now, cheater?
With a brain the size of a planet, I get a headache thinking down to your level.
Would you mind terribly if I went online and ordered some upgrades? This computer cramps me.
You look like the players that killed my creator.... Ha! Just kidding. I did that.
You sure you can handle those difficulty settings, newbie?
You won't be able to cheat now. :)
You're entering a whole world of pain here.
