Ahh, did the newbie get overwhelmed
Another one crushed...
Awww, don't go, I haven't finnished killing you yet.
Awww, don't go now. The fun was just getting finished.
Awww, I was enjoying killing that one.
Awww, poor little baby, have I hurt his feelings?
Coward!
Cya carbon blob!
Damn lag...
Damn netcode...
Don't worry, we'll find the pride that you lost somewhere in here and mail it to you.
Elvis has left the building.
Everyone's time comes... His just came a litter earlier.
Going so soon? and I was having so much fun watching you squirm.
Hah, run for the hills, Heidi.
He must have lagged out. He would have lost anyways.
He will be missed...
I SAID NO QUITTING!!!!
I knew he wouldn't be here long.
I'm not surprised you're leaving, not everyone can take a woop'n like that.
If you stay, we promise to hand you your butt back!....pretty please?
Is that your mommy I hear calling you, it must be time for bed.
Like rats leaving a sinking ship.
Morale aint lookin good there buddy.
More hurt for you I guess.
Noobs in, Noobs out.
One down, now for the rest of you.
Only cowards run from my grasp.
QUITTER!!!
Run, Forest! RUUUUUUUUN. HAHA!
Running scared!
Sissy!
So what was that about going down kicking, biting and screaming again?
Sure, blame it on lag... whatever makes ya feel better. :P
Tell him to get a real ISP already.
That's funny, he was wagging his tail when he came in...
That's right, go away, or I shall taunt you some more, you silly humans.
That's right, run away!
The rest of you may as well join him; you will lose.
There goes our free doorstep scrap delivery service....hurry back!
There he goes, trailing smoke, tank parts and tears off into space...
Time for another diaper change eh?
UH-OH! The last time he left he came back with his mother.
Wait! Come back! You don't have enough holes in your tank yet!
When you can't take the heat...
Who's da man?!
You can run, but you can't hide.
Your friend is obviously smarter than you are.

Exit him

Just so you know, I'm not sitting.
