*BURRRRP*....  NEXT!
*I* am the command-dot-com!
...... and people wonder why I have a superiority complex.
:P
And you thought I was stupid.
Are those scavie pilots they're sending out to fight us?
BWAHAHA! That one is wearing a DRESS!
Call out the scavies, haha.
Chair rides! free chair rides! bring your own tank and get your free chair rides!... over here!
Clean up in aisle 9!
Damn lag, I had you way before.
Eat transistor rage!!
Eject! Eject! Eject! Too late!
Enjoy your ride!
FOOD FIGHT! FOOD FIGHT!
Fly the friendly skies.
Follow him! That recruit will lead us straight to his base!
Four!
Get out and walk, it looks like you need the exercise.
Getting run over by a scavenger... now *that* would be funny.
Glide this way, we want to show you something....
HINT: Quit sucking on your THUMB.... NOOB!
Happy landings! >:)
Happy landings!
He shoots... he scores!
Hey, are you sure you're old enough to drive that thing?!?
Hey, don't float off. Come back. I won't shoot you, again. I promise. (Snicker)
Hey, why don't you pull out your sniper rifle?  
How's the weather up there?
I guess you should have zigged instead of zagged, huh?
I have heard monkeys can play this game and your actions have supported this theory.
I hope that was paid for.
I like you....you amuse me.
I tell ya, they just keep going and going and... oops, never mind.
I think you are in need of some driving lessons.
I think you should stick to dunking scavs!
I'm not left-handed either.
If you can't do something well, enjoy doing it poorly.
In space, nobody can hear your screaming. But, it seems very probable right now.
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's... target practice time! >:)
It's a long walk home, now I see why you guys have jetpacks
It's all about triangulation. Maybe you should have paid more attention in math class.
It's like a barber shop quartet!  Minus one...
Jordan... for three... yes!
Just one more juicy Jak snack.
Ka-PING!
Keep sending that scrap over, all the more to squash you with.
Killing Spree!
Learn to live with disappointment.
Let me guess, lag right?
Life is a journey, watch where you land...
Maybe you should go back to farming and driving tractors.
More scrap for us...
MuahaahaahaahaahaahaahaaAAA!!!
Must have been my warp-shields RIGHT!?
NEXT!!!!
NO SKILLS...NO KILLS...NO THRILLS... try harder, IF you can.
NOTICE: School is officially in session.
Nice catch!
Nice view from up there?
No, we REFUSE TO WAIT while you get another tank.
Not so tough now, are ya?
Nothing But Blood.
Oh sure, blame your mouse.
One less mess.
Oooohh! barfed in your helmet AGAIN yes?
Oooooooohh yyyeeeeeeeeaaaa!
PULL!
Pop goes the weasel!
Quick! Call Triple-A!
Scrap for me and a death for you.
Splash one!
Struggling only makes it harder.
Surrender now and I'll let you live.
Next time, try OPENING your eyes and SHUTTING your mouth when you're shooting at me! lol
Thanks for the scrap :) your pilot is next.
That can't be good!
That compression can't be good for your back!
There's no use in crying, I don't feel sorry for you.
They don't make 'em like they used to.
To err is human... boy, that must suck.
Want some humble pie to go with that fragging... pinhead?
Want some more?
Was everybody watchin' that?
We regret to inform you that your hair is on fire.
Wheee! There's "slingshot charlie" going ballistic again.
Who's the man!?
Who's your daddy?
Why don't you go put some bling on your next ride at the Factory.
Wow look at all the sparks!
Wow, and I wasn't even trying!
Yes, that's how it's done...
You go get some rest. I'll finish up here.
You like that, Punk Buddy?
You need special help.
You should have hit CTRL+B and saved me the time.
Yup, you're a real space cadet.
