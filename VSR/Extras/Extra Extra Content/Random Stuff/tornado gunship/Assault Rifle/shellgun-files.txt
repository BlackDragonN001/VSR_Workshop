This archive contains files borrowed from the FE shellgun and needed by the Assault Rifle, such as muzzle flash textures and sounds. Since 1.3 PB3 complains that these files already exist, I have zipped them in order to get it to stop complaining. If the shellgun is missing textures then please unzip them back into this folder.

The archive (Bzip2 format) contains the following files
muz2.tga
muzfir.tga
shell.tga
shellcar.wav
shellgnd.wav
shellgun.wav
