ELEMENTAL WEAPONS (By Zero Angel)

Well, I was playing an RPG the other day and thought, "hey, what if
the idea of elements could be worked into BZ2?" Then I thought about how
natural effects might affect armour, and how if these primitive forces
were combined what kinds of things they can do to ships. So here
is what I ended up jotting down.

Fire Elemental:
Energy Damage
Variable hits, variable dmg
Absorbable

Wind elemental:
Physical (slash) Damage
Multiple hits, low dmg
Deflectable

Earth Elemental:
Physical (crush) Damage
Few hits, high dmg
Deflectable

Water Elemental
Physical (pierce) Damage
Multiple hits, low dmg
Deflectable

Ice Elemental
Energy or Physical Damage
Variable hits, variable dmg
Absorbable and deflectable
confuses shielding

Void Elemental
Energy (slash) Damage
Stream, high local dmg (eats matter)
Absorbable

Lightning Elemental
Energy (pierce+impact) damage
Few hits, high dmg
Absorbable

--------------------------------------------

Meteor (Earth+Wind)
Physical (Crush) Damage
Few hits, tremendous damage
+Splash
Deflectable

Quicksand (Earth+Water)
Effect
Slows movement in a zone for extended periods

Magma Eruption (Earth+Fire)
Several magma blasts erupt from the ground causing physical and energy
damage and propelling units into the air.
Best protection using stasis shielding.

Steam (Fire+Water)
many many hits, low dmg
Energy damage
Confuses shielding

Heat Wave (Fire+Wind)
Energy Damage, Saturates area with heat and melts light armor.
Absorbable

Plasma Rain (Fire+Lightning)
Fountain type weapon which saturates area with energy damage.
Absorbable

Vacuum (Void+Ice)
Physical Antimatter Damage
Stops movement in a small zone and damages targets
Deflectable
(Technical: One idea is to use a flaremine which fires a single magnetshell (negative shotradius so as
	not to be destroyed) into the air, this shell will suck units in and keep them in stasis
	until the shell expires and detonates into a huge midair explosion.

M-Barrier (Void+Wind)
Protects area by deflecting ordinances.
Has no effect on fast energy weapons (blast/laser/gauss).
May interfere with the attacks of units firing from within the sphere.
Can also be used as a personal shield for ships, but recommend to use salvolauncher in combination
	with localammo for limited uses.

Geo-Barrier (Earth + Ice)
Prevents entry into an area for a short period of time.

Acid Rain (Void+Water)
Wide area attack which damages all objects slowly
Damage is zeroed out by deflection shielding

EMP Burst (Void+Lightning)
Disables ships in various manners (IE: sandbag)

Lightning Storm (Lightning + Wind)
Destabilizes area with winds, lightning bolts hit units in the target area

Shockwave (Wind)
Fires a pulse which scatters all nearby units.
