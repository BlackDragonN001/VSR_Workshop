Notes on Hadean model changes, by GBD:

! This operation is to be kept secret. Do not tell anyone what I have done :P

Added hp_Smoke_1 to all vehicles.

ebscup/ebscav models: Rebuilt mesh, seems to fix the inside out bug.

evkami00, made Fins able to move/added animations. Also tweaked uvmapping on inner left top side of vent to make it pure black like the rest.

evmisl00, fixed incorrect uvmapping on main body.

ebfact02, fixed duplicate faces causing model to build partially white. 

ebcbun00, made terminal glass 2g, to make it transparent.

ebsbay00, fixed sbay hp_com_1 so it's inside physical collision. Helps with AI aiming. 

evrecy00/evrecy00df, moved track support strut (a single vert) down and forward some, to help prevent clipping during the deploy animation.

evturr00, Seperated gun mounts from barrels, so that they can have recoils if desired. 

evmislL1/L2, evscavL1/L2, evtankL1/L2: Mesh rebuilt, fixes inside out bug.
