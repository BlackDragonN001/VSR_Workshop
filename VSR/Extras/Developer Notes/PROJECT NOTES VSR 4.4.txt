 >> RECENT CHANGES   \___________________________________________________________________________


August 25, 2013
- Fixed Unit Icon on starting vehicle version of the Brawler
- Lowered HP of the starting (DM) version of the Zeus from 3000 to 2700
- Resin Bomb effect radius lowered from 100 to 70m.
- Re-added guardian AA capability due to lack of satisfaction with popper
    as an anti-bomber weapon.

August 24, 2013
- Removed 'jump' from sundae bomber as it was preventing AI sundae bombers from 
    traversing hills.
- Some tweaking done to ISDF scavengers (dynamicFrictionCoeff) to reduce oversteering
    which contributed to pathing difficulties
 
August 17, 2013
- Fixes done to corrupt effects on some pool ODFs from 1.3SMP map import.

August 16, 2013
- Fixed maps defaulting to friendly fire OFF which has had its behavior changed in 6.4m
- Fixed Hadean pilots regaining sniper rifle when going into sat mode (experimental variant)
- Re-added Icecream INFs to asset tree (they may need updating)

August 9, 2013
- Moved various weapons (assualt rifle, hoverpacks, resin bomb) from plus variant armory to
  experimental version armory.
- Updated iweaponvsr and fweaponvsr to reflect changes

August 8, 2013
- Rearranged some options on vsrST EO page.
- Vearie's Map Selector hooked up to vsrST EO page.
- Added a help button on vsrST EO page. Explains what the buttons do.
- DLL Updates by General Blackdragon.
- Hadean MSH's rebuilt. Various fixes such as hp_smoke added. Contributed by Ponies.

August 3, 2013
- All 1.3 Strategy Map Pack (1.3SMP) Maps converted to use the VSR DLL and defaults. Contributed by Vearie.
- Visual Map Selector added to assets. Contributed by Vearie.
- Configswitcher bat scripts improved greatly. Now switches out vehicle lists instead of map INFs and
  shell cfgs.
- All Vehicle Lists now use the ODF file extension. Pre 1.3.6.4 files also now use the ODF extension
    even though internally they use the old-style format. Thanks Vearie for the suggestion.
- Icecream Pilot glitching fixed by repairing weapon model. Contributed by GBD.


June - August 2, 2013
- Hadean Flame Mine HP reduced from 0 (invincible) to 250
- Lancer acceleration reduced.
- Acid Cloud damage profile changed. Now does less damage in its outer radius, but slightly 
    increased damage in the inner radius. Done by overlapping damage fields and lowering the damage 
    of the outer field.
- Popper. Velocforward reduced (less accurate against moving targets at long range). Seeking capability 
  vs moving targets reduced. Attempts to get it to consistently hit bomber more often attempted. Will
  no longer fly so incredibly far.  Needs more work.
- Multilock Missile. Turning speed lowered from 1.8 to 1.5 (stock).
- Blink. Reduced shotdelay (cooldown) from 2.5 seconds to 2.0 seconds
- Guardian Turrets. AA Capability removed.
- Scion Empty Scouts. Found an ODF entry which gives them a strafing speed of 20 (over the fullscout's 
  15). This is a carry-over from stock 1.3, but may be attributed to the Scion's ability to easily overpower
  minigun scouts and go toe-to-toe with laser scouts. Lowered to 16.5.


== Pre 1 Released ==

June 11, 2013

- Integrated DLL versions into the configswitcher bat scripts
- Update to InnoSetup file to do version detection
- Compiled VSR prerelease 1.

June 10, 2013

- DLL Updates from General Blackdragon added. Including <6.4 and >=6.4 versions.
	- 6.4 versions now have the ability to set portal channel based on label, only requiring one ODF.

June 9, 2013

- Forked legacy and modern versions of shell cfgs which call vehicle lists
- Wrote scripts which switch between legacy and modern versions

June 8, 2013

- Created vehicle lists for 1.3.6.4+ (thanks vearie for the script to convert legacy vehicle lists to the new spec)

June 6, 2013

- Major IC update package from Vearie (see document "IC Changes VSR 4.4.txt" for full list)
- dbtcen_vsr now provides itself, dbpowe_tcen_vsr now provides itself
- All IC objects which previously required dbtcen_vsr now require dbpowe_tcen
- All buildings and building variants now have provides equal to their own ODF names (needed for AIP compatibility)


June 4, 2013

- Added Hadean and Anti-Hadean AIP set based on 1.2 FE's AIP set and using VSR units.
- Hadeans now selectable as a CPU race in MPI


June 2, 2013

- Added VSR-compatible standard AIPs, based on Wug Difficult AIP set using VSR Units


Changes done earlier than June 2, 2013

- Updated ST/FFA DLL by General Blackdragon
	- Recycler pack-up will now require a free F group
	- Resolved any issues with pilots losing or regaining weapons when satellite view is entered
	- Teleporters will not lose power when other buildings lose their lungs
- Portals now require only 65 scrap (from 80), have 6000HP (from 5000), and require a service 
	bay and commbunker instead of a tech center.
- Fixed 'missing files' problem when a player starts as IC in the experimental variant.
- Empty Xypos Flame Mine bug fixed.




_____________________
 >> PENDING TASKS    \___________________________________________________________________________


TODO [important]
	Identify pilot resync bug and fix if possible.

TODO [important]
	Tweak popper some more. Make it an ideal bomber killer.

TODO [moderate]
	Test and tweak all existing AIP sets where needed
	Note, additional attack plans can be added to substitute redundant plans in some of the Hadean AIPs.

TODO [moderate]
	Write AIPs for IC

TODO [optional]
	More 'human like' AIP simulation. Reduce amount of smart scouts overall but build a few smart
	scouts which target combat craft (like the player).

TODO [optional]
	Increased variety of pilot weapons. Soldier DM Mode.

TODO [optional]
	Shim to allow use of ZEMod soldiers in regular VSR DM if ZE is installed

TODO [optional]
	Further Map Imports for FFA mode

TODO [optional]
	FFA: VSR: Scrap Pit Extreme -- fix terrain near base so it's level with base pool.

TODO [optional]
	Rebuild bazooka external geometry, attempt to solve glitching problem

TODO [optional]
	Sniper Forest: Redo cabin fire effect, make it an emit so it works w/o headlights
	   Increase cabin HP, make trees indestructable, give boids a blood explosion
