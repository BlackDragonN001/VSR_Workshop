The Mode Selection Buttons do the following:

>> VSR Standard:

This is the regular mode which features all of the core VSR balance and physics changes.
Everything else is a bonus.

>> VSR Plus:

This mode has everything that VSR Standard has, in addition it also contains Smart Scouts (improved dogfighting AI, weapon linking), undeployable recyclers, and the ISDF and Scion teams gain access to the Hammer and Brawler rocket bombers from the Forgotten Enemies mod.

>> VSR Experimental:

 - Buildable Portals

>> Stock Mode

This is used to reset map defaults to use stock 1.3 (non-VSR) ships and recyclers.
