Do not modify, add, or remove anything in this folder.

If you want to change the appearance of your in-game shell, you need to COPY files from this folder to the following directory:

...My Documents\My Games\Battlezone Combat Commander\addon

Note that the addon folder does not exist by default:
Create a NEW folder in the "Battlezone Combat Commander" folder called "addon" (no quotes).

Modify the COPIED files in the new addon folder, but do not modify files in VSR's folders. They will be overridden when VSR updates.


WARNING: Not everything in the new addon folder can be added or modified without causing "bad assets" kicks from games.
		If you add something to addon that causes bad assets, simply remove it (or fix it).
