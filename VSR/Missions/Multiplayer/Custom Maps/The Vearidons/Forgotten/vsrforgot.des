I understand that Archers, Furies, Scion Gunships, and possibly Bombers can all be piloted. However, I wish to know if APCs and other flying units can be piloted by humans in certain mods or patches...

P.S. It must be f**king wonderful to pilot an APC. Just imagine, being in control of dropping off soldiers and returning them to safety, and possibly even rescuing your own commander or fellow pilots from enemy territory... (without them relying on jetpacks or unit pick-ups)
