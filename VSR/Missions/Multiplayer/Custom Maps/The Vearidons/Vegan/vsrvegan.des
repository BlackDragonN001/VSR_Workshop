I am a vegan and an atheist. I am passionate about animal rights, human rights and being rational.
You don't have to be an atheist to be vegan, and you don't have to be vegan to be an atheist, but it makes the most sense to be both.
Expand your perceptions, grow as an individual, and make a meaningful change. Go Vegan.
