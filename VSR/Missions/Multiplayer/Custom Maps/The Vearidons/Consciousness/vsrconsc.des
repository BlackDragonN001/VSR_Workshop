This arsehole demystifies consciousness? Consciousness is what the 5 senses present through the brain for the decisions of the user, the spirit (energy). There's only the intangible spirit (energy) and the tangible body (including brain), you bearded arsehole, Dumb Dennett! E = MC2 ENERGY = MassXthe speed of light squared (186,000X186,000 square miles per second) Energy = MassX 34,596,000,000 square miles per second Jesus (is alleged to have) said, "God is a Spirit (ENERGY- the Ultimate Intangible) God is everywhere Yahweh of the Jews was/is an alien. The same who tempted Jesus with worldly possessions. Jesus was the son of a compassionate alien, superior to Yahweh, thus Jesus reminding Yahweh "Thou shall not tempt the Lord, thy God." Mary, Jesus' mother, was impregnated with the seed of the alien, unknown to her, something done today by man with artificial insemination. "The son can do nothing of himself" (John 5: 19). This alien was not God, who is everywhere, but in sync with the powers of God. Paul Hellyer, a former Canadian minister of the Federal government, said that the 'star' the Magi followed was probably the exhaust of a UFO. Jesus, a human/alien offspring, is reported to have said, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me." There is NO death! Mission accomplished! 'Nuff said!?
